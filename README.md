# Fi(sh) Fo(od) Re(minder)

A project that helps remind me when it is time to feed my fish.


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

A combination of hardware and software, the system uses a Raspberry Pi Pico, a push button, and an LED to periodically let the user know that it is time to feed their fish.


### Programmed With

This project was programmed in [MicroPython](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/), a language largely compatible with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) that is optimized to run on a microcontroller.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The system can be built using off the shelf components, and the software can be uploaded using a free IDE. The behavior can also be easily modified by changing just a few lines of code in the main.py source file.


### Hardware

While there are multiple ways to put the system together, this design used an ESP32, three jumper cables, a push button, a red LED, and a 220 ohm resistor. A Fritzing diagram can be found in the images folder.


### Software

The [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) IDE was used to program the system and upload the code to the Pico.
